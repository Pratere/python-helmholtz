Python bindings for [[http://cococubed.asu.edu/code_pages/eos.shtml][Frank Timmes' Helmholtz EoS]].
** Prerequisites
You must have numpy and a fortran compiler installed.  This is only
tested on python3, though in principle one should be able to
relatively easily adapt it to python2.
** Installation
Simply type
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make module
#+END_EXAMPLE
and then add this directory to your python path
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
export $PYTHONPATH=/path/to/module:$PYTHONPATH
#+END_EXAMPLE
